# todo for completion of thesis

- write conclusion
- finish gut microbiome alignment experiment and plot results
- write algorithm for MEM finding
- fix y-axis scale on histograms in 3.1
- say that 3.2, 3.3, 3.6, 3.7, table 3.2, are reproduced from the NBT paper
- flip the labels on axes in 3.8
- note that in 3.12 we are jittering integer counts thus the quantization

- put in figures from presentation in chapter 1
  - tree figure
  - tubemap variation graph
- add GBWT figure (note to Jouni)
- complete section on alignment against a splicing graph
  - add figure from cpang paper (splicing graph)
  - show preliminary alignment results for yeast splicing graph
- describe methods contributions
  - survey paper
  - graph genomes paper
  - gPBWT paper
