  This work responds to ideas that arose in conversation with Deniz Kural.
  Our friendship is the first reason that I became a biologist, and his exploration of graphical models for genomes inspired my own.
  It is thanks to Alexander Wait Zaranek that we had the opportunity to work in George Church's lab, which pulled us both into biology our previous fields.
  There I met Madeline Price Ball, who guided me during an immersive and engaging introduction to biology and genomics.
  
  Deniz introduced me to Gabor Marth, with whom I apprenticed in the art of bioinformatics.
  Gabor encouraged me to contribute extensively to the 1000 Genomes Project, whose objective captured my imagination and whose participants, in particular the members of the analysis group, taught me many lessons in the way of science.
  I can thank Hyun Min Kang, Goncalo Abecasis, Mark DePristo, Ryan Poplin, Zam Iqbal, and Heng Li, for always motivating me, and for helping me to understand and correct the many mistakes I made.
  Meanwhile, Mengyao Zhao and Wan-Ping Lee gave me my first look inside the alignment algorithms that are such an important part of this thesis.

  During those years I had the pleasure of living with Benjamin ``Mako'' Hill and Mika Matsuzaki, who showed me what it means to work as a scientist for the commons.
  Not only did I learn from them, but from the many thinkers, dreamers, and travellers who they brought into our life in Somerville.
  These include Hanna Wallach, who helped me to understand the theory and practice of the learning problems I first encountered in genomics, and Nicol\'{a}s Della Penna, who continues to shape my understanding of many aspects of the scientific artifice, in particular the fuzzy boundary between the social and the technical.
  
  This thesis would cover a considerably narrower set of topics if not for the efforts of the many people who have I have worked with to build the variation graph toolkit, {\tt vg}.
  These include, but are not limited to,
  Jouni Sir\'{e}n,
  Benedict Paten,
  Eric Dawson,
  Shilpa Garg,
  Adam Novak,
  Charles Markello,
  Hajime Suzuki,
  Jordan Eizenga,
  Mike Lin,
  Glenn Hickey,
  Jerven Bolleman,
  and Toshiaki Katayama.

  Pedro Fernandes gave Tobias Marschall and me the chance to teach a course on pangenomics using {\tt vg}, which motivated many of the applications of variation graphs that I present here.
  Eppie Jones and Rui Martiniano have motivated and guided my work on ancient DNA.
  Remo Sanges and Mariella Ferrante gave me a lab to be part of and a fascinating project to explore in my time in Napoli.
  
  Working with Richard Durbin has been a singular pleasure.
  The group he leads is motivated by his wide ranging interests that span the whole of biology.
  I owe its former and current members thanks for their encouragement over the years, and to Richard for his impeccably supportive guidance and expansive, encouraging vision for our work.

  Without my family, it is unlikely I would have ever begun the meandering trip that has led me to this thesis. 
  My parents helped me to be independent, and opened my mind to the world of ideas, which set me out on a wonderful trip.
  Along the way, my brother and sister have kept me honest and careful of myself.

  Much of this trip has been alongside my partner Enza Colonna.
  Non le posso dire quanto mi hai aiutato, o quanti passi ho fatto in questo viaggo secondo le ideé che abbiamo condiviso.
  I also am greatful to her parents, Donato e Concetta, under whose almond and olive trees I wrote many pages of this work.
  Mi hanno liberato dai problemi tipici della vita quotidiana, e con il loro aiuto potevo elaborare tutta la tesí in una sola mese.
  
  Our daughter, Exa, who always convinces me to play, made sure that I was never too tired to keep going.
  I look forward to sharing this with her.
